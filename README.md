# point-logstash
ELK stack accepting user logs from the Point Node

Based on:
![docker-elk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deviantony/docker-elk)
## Usage

**:warning: You must rebuild the stack images with `docker-compose build` whenever you switch branch or update the
[version](#version-selection) of an already existing stack.**

### Bringing up the stack

Clone this repository onto the Docker host that will run the stack, then start the stack's services locally using Docker
Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```
Give Kibana about a minute to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by opening <http://localhost:5601> in a web
browser and use the following (default) credentials to log in:

* user: *elastic*
* password: *changeme*

*:information_source: Upon the initial startup, the `elastic`, `logstash_internal` and `kibana_system` Elasticsearch
users are intialized with the values of the passwords defined in the [`.env`](.env) file (_"changeme"_ by default). The
first one is the [built-in superuser][builtin-users], the other two are used by Kibana and Logstash respectively to
communicate with Elasticsearch. This task is only performed during the _initial_ startup of the stack. To change users'
passwords _after_ they have been initialized, please refer to the instructions in the next section.*

### Initial setup

#### Setting up user authentication

The _"changeme"_ password set by default for all aforementioned users is **unsecure**. For increased security, we will
reset the passwords of all aforementioned Elasticsearch users to random secrets.

1. Reset passwords for default users

    The commands below resets the passwords of the `elastic`, `logstash_internal` and `kibana_system` users. Take note
    of them.

    ```console
    $ docker-compose exec elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password --batch --user elastic --url https://localhost:9200
    ```

    ```console
    $ docker-compose exec elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password --batch --user logstash_internal --url https://localhost:9200
    ```

    ```console
    $ docker-compose exec elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-reset-password --batch --user kibana_system --url https://localhost:9200
    ```

    If the need for it arises (e.g. if you want to [collect monitoring information][ls-monitoring] through Beats and
    other components), feel free to repeat this operation at any time for the rest of the [built-in
    users][builtin-users].

1. Replace usernames and passwords in configuration files

    Replace the password of the `elastic` user inside the `.env` file with the password generated in the previous step.
    Its value isn't used by any core component, but [extensions](#how-to-enable-the-provided-extensions) use it to
    connect to Elasticsearch.

    *:information_source: In case you don't plan on using any of the provided
    [extensions](#how-to-enable-the-provided-extensions), or prefer to create your own roles and users to authenticate
    these services, it is safe to remove the `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` entry from the `.env` file altogether after the stack
    has been initialized.*

    Replace the password of the `logstash_internal` user inside the `.env` file with the password generated in the
    previous step. Its value is referenced inside the Logstash pipeline file (`logstash/pipeline/logstash.conf`).

    Replace the password of the `kibana_system` user inside the `.env` file with the password generated in the previous
    step. Its value is referenced inside the Kibana configuration file (`kibana/config/kibana.yml`).

    See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for more information about these configuration files.

1. Restart Logstash and Kibana to re-connect to Elasticsearch using the new passwords

    ```console
    $ docker-compose up -d logstash kibana
    ```

*:information_source: Learn more about the security of the Elastic stack at [Secure the Elastic Stack][sec-cluster].*

### Cleanup

Elasticsearch data is persisted inside a volume by default.

In order to entirely shutdown the stack and remove all persisted data, use the following Docker Compose command:

```console
$ docker-compose down -v
```
## Configuration

*:information_source: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart individual components after
any configuration change.*

### How to configure Elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch configuration is stored in [`elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml`][config-es].

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
elasticsearch:

  environment:
    network.host: _non_loopback_
    cluster.name: my-cluster
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Elasticsearch inside Docker
containers: [Install Elasticsearch with Docker][es-docker].

### How to configure Kibana

The Kibana default configuration is stored in [`kibana/config/kibana.yml`][config-kbn].

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
kibana:

  environment:
    SERVER_NAME: kibana.example.org
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Kibana inside Docker
containers: [Install Kibana with Docker][kbn-docker].

### How to configure Logstash

The Logstash configuration is stored in [`logstash/config/logstash.yml`][config-ls].

You can also specify the options you want to override by setting environment variables inside the Compose file:

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LOG_LEVEL: debug
```

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about how to configure Logstash inside Docker
containers: [Configuring Logstash for Docker][ls-docker].

### How to reset a password programmatically

If for any reason your are unable to use Kibana to change the password of your users (including [built-in
users][builtin-users]), you can use the Elasticsearch API instead and achieve the same result.

In the example below, we reset the password of the `elastic` user (notice "/user/elastic" in the URL):

```console
$ curl -XPOST -D- 'https://localhost:9200/_security/user/elastic/_password' \
    --cacert tls/kibana/elasticsearch-ca.pem \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -u elastic:<your current elastic password> \
    -d '{"password" : "<your new password>"}'
```

## Extensibility

### How to add plugins

To add plugins to any ELK component you have to:

1. Add a `RUN` statement to the corresponding `Dockerfile` (eg. `RUN logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-json`)
1. Add the associated plugin code configuration to the service configuration (eg. Logstash input/output)
1. Rebuild the images using the `docker-compose build` command

### How to enable the provided extensions

A few extensions are available inside the [`extensions`](extensions) directory. These extensions provide features which
are not part of the standard Elastic stack, but can be used to enrich it with extra integrations.

The documentation for these extensions is provided inside each individual subdirectory, on a per-extension basis. Some
of them require manual changes to the default ELK configuration.

## JVM tuning

### How to specify the amount of memory used by a service

By default, both Elasticsearch and Logstash start with [1/4 of the total host
memory](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html#default_heap_size) allocated to
the JVM Heap Size.

The startup scripts for Elasticsearch and Logstash can append extra JVM options from the value of an environment
variable, allowing the user to adjust the amount of memory that can be used by each component:

| Service       | Environment variable |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Elasticsearch | ES_JAVA_OPTS         |
| Logstash      | LS_JAVA_OPTS         |

To accomodate environments where memory is scarce (Docker for Mac has only 2 GB available by default), the Heap Size
allocation is capped by default to 256MB per service in the `docker-compose.yml` file. If you want to override the
default JVM configuration, edit the matching environment variable(s) in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

For example, to increase the maximum JVM Heap Size for Logstash:

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LS_JAVA_OPTS: -Xmx1g -Xms1g
```

### How to enable a remote JMX connection to a service

As for the Java Heap memory (see above), you can specify JVM options to enable JMX and map the JMX port on the Docker
host.

Update the `{ES,LS}_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable with the following content (I've mapped the JMX service on the port
18080, you can change that). Do not forget to update the `-Djava.rmi.server.hostname` option with the IP address of your
Docker host (replace **DOCKER_HOST_IP**):

```yml
logstash:

  environment:
    LS_JAVA_OPTS: -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18080 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=18080 -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=DOCKER_HOST_IP -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false
```
